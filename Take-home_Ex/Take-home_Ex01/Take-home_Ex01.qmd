# 1 **Overview**

## 1.1 **Background**

There are two major residential property market in Singapore, namely public and private housing. Public housing aims to meet the basic need of the general public with monthly household income less than or equal to S\$14,000. For families with monthly household income more than S\$14,000, they need to turn to the private residential market.

We will go to prepare minimum two and maximum three data visualisation to reveal the private residential market and sub-markets of Singapore for the 1st quarter of 2024.

## **1.2 Data Import**

##### There are five files in the folder. Each file provdes transacion data for a quarter. The study period is from 1st January 2023 until 31st March 2024.

![](Data%20Picture%201.jpg)

##### First, let us merge the csv files.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(dplyr, purrr, readr, ggiraph,
               ggplot2, lubridate, ggrepel,
               patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, tidyverse)
data_dir <- "data-2"
file_paths <- file.path(data_dir,
                        c("2023Q1.csv",
                          "2023Q2.csv",
                          "2023Q3.csv",
                          "2023Q4.csv",
                          "2024Q1.csv"))
combined_data <- purrr::map_df(file_paths, readr::read_csv)
glimpse(combined_data)
readr::write_csv(combined_data,
                 file.path(data_dir,"merged_transaction_data.csv"))

```

## **1.3 Data check**

According to the combined_data, there are 26,806 observation of 21 variables before we make a data cleaning.

![](Data%20Picture%202.png)

Now we need to check the duplicate.

```{r}
duplicate <- combined_data %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(n()>1) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
duplicate
```

Congratulation, there is no duplicate according to our find!

## **1.4 Variable Selection**

##### We choose "Transacted Price (\$)", "Area (SQFT)", "Unit Price (\$ PSF)", "Sale Data", "Type of sale", "Property Type", "Purchaser Address Indicator", and "Planning Region" as our values.

## **1.5 Missing Values**

##### Now we need to check the missing values, since too many N/A will influence certain calculations.

::: panel-tabset
##### *Transacted Price (\$)*

```{r}
sum(is.na(combined_data$`Transacted Price ($)`))
```

Congratulation, there is no missing data according to our find!

# **2. Problem Solveing**

To solve this problem, we will make a visualization.

## **2.1 Property Type & Planning Region**

First, we want to know which property type is popular in private residential market and sub-markets of Singapore, and how the resident located in Singapore.

```{r}
F1 <- ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = `Property Type`)) + 
    geom_bar_interactive(aes(fill = `Planning Region`), position = "dodge") +  
    labs(x = "Property Type", y = "Frequency",
         title = "Frequency of Property Types by Planning Region") +
    facet_wrap(~ `Planning Region`, scales = "free") +
    theme_stata(base_size = 2.5)
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
F1
```

We have now acquired transaction data pertaining to six distinct property types: Apartment, Condominium, Terrace House, Executive Condominium, Detached House, and Semi-Detached House. These properties are situated across five planning regions: Central Region, East Region, North East Region, North Region, and West Region.

Upon analysis, it is evident that the market for detached houses, semi-detached houses, and terrace houses is considerably limited, with minimal activity observed.

Furthermore, our findings reveal noteworthy trends across different regions. In the North Region, Executive Condominiums emerge as the most sought-after property type, boasting the highest number of transactions compared to other regions. Similarly, in the West Region, Executive Condominiums exhibit robust trading activity.

Across most regions, Apartments and Condominiums consistently dominate the market as preferred sale properties, with the exception of the North Region, where unique market dynamics are observed.

After thorough analysis, it becomes apparent that each quarter exhibits a comparable range of transacted prices, with Q1 2024 demonstrating a notably higher transacted price compared to Q1 2023.

Moreover, the distribution of transacted prices and areas across all transactions reveals that 99% of deals fall within the range of 300 to 1,500 square feet, with corresponding prices ranging from 1,100 to 3,750 thousand SGD. This distribution underscores the prevailing market trends and preferences within the real estate landscape.

Upon examination of the violin plots, a clear disparity emerges between the average unit prices of condominiums and apartments, standing at approximately \$1,500 and \$2,000, respectively, for the period spanning January to March. Noteworthy is the discernible uptick in both unit price and transaction volume from January to March 2024. Despite an overall reduction in total transactions vis-a-vis the preceding year, there is an unmistakable trend towards growth within specific sub-markets, suggesting an increasing inclination towards higher-value properties

# 3 **Summary**

Through this exercise, we illustrated the situation of current private residential market and sub-markets of Singapore. The current private residential market in Singapore showcases diverse property types distributed across different planning regions. While Apartments and Condominiums remain popular choices in most areas, Executive Condominiums demonstrate significant demand, particularly in the North and West Regions. Detached houses, semi-detached houses, and terrace houses, however, exhibit minimal activity in the market. These trends underscore a nuanced landscape within the Singaporean real estate sector, reflecting varying preferences and dynamics across different sub-markets.
